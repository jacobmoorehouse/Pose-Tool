<h1> Welcome to our posing tool! </h1>

<p class = "Intro"> We will be building a posing tool that recreates the human body and allow artists to have a 
	semi-realistic reference. Each part of the body will be able to rotate a full 360 degrees except 
	exceptions that we feel will be needed. 
	In order to do this we will program every limb as a straight, unbendable rod and each joint as a sphere.
	Then we will replace each rod with a 3D model of what object should be there.
	The user will be able to fully rotate the entire body by dragging the screen and perhaps even zooming in.<p>
<p class = "Names"> Codine is made of Junze He and Jacob Moorehouse. </p>
