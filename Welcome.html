	<h1 id="billboard"> Welcome to our posing tool! </h1>

	<p class = "Intro" style = "display:none"> We will be building a posing tool that recreates the human body and allow artists to have a 
	semi-realistic reference. Each part of the body will be able to rotate a full 360 degrees except 
	exceptions that we feel will be needed. 
	In order to do this we will program every limb as a straight, unbendable rod and each joint as a sphere.
	Then we will replace each rod with a 3D model of what object should be there.
	The user will be able to fully rotate the entire body by dragging the screen and perhaps even zooming in.
	Additionally, we will allow the user to save the current pose as a jpeg for future reference, 
	and even change certain features of the human body, and changing its gender. <p>
	
	<p class="Instructions" style="margin-left:12%;display:none">Drag to move the figure around. Use arrow keys to pan. To assist in selecting objects, zoom in more.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="Instructions"style = "display:none">There are two types of controls. One type of controls keeps the object centered at (0,0,0) and the other type allows you to pan with the arrow keys. </p>
	<br>
